Although genetics has traditionally been associated with pregnancy, birth\\ndefects, and newborn screening, almost every disease is influenced in part by an individual’s\\ngenetic makeup. Therefore, it is important to consider the impact of genetics in health and\\ndisease throughout an individual’s lifetime.\\nThe purpose of this manual is to provide an educational genetics resource for individuals,\\nfamilies, and health professionals in the New York – Mid-Atlantic region and increase awareness\\nof specialty care in genetics. The manual begins with a basic introduction to genetics concepts,\\nfollowed by a description of the different types and applications of genetic tests. It also provides\\ninformation about diagnosis of genetic disease, family history, newborn screening, and genetic\\ncounseling. Resources are included to assist in patient care, patient and professional education,\\nand identification of specialty genetics services within the New York – Mid-Atlantic region. At\\nthe end of each section, a list of references is provided for additional information. Appendices\\ncan be copied for reference and offered to patients. These take-home resources are critical to\\nhelping both providers and patients understand some of the basic concepts and applications of\\ngenetics and genomics.\\nThe original manual was created by Genetic Alliance with funding from the District of\\nColumbia Department of Health, through U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\\n(HHS) Health Resource and Services Administration (HRSA) Grant #5 H91 MC 00228-03.\\nGenetic Alliance transforms health through genetics. We promote an environment of openness\\ncentered on the health of individuals, families, and communities.\\nWe bring together diverse stakeholders to create novel partnerships in advocacy. Genetic\\nAlliance’s network includes hundreds of disease-specific advocacy organizations, as well as\\nuniversities, companies, government agencies, and policy organizations. The network is an open\\nspace for thousands of shared resources, creative tools, and dozens of focused programs.\\nWe revolutionize access to information to enable translation of research into services and\\nindividualized decision-making. Genetic Alliance offers technical assistance to organizations, builds\\nand sustains robust information systems, and actively works for public policies that promote the\\ntranslation of basic research into therapies and treatments. In particular, Genetic Alliance identifies\\nsolutions to emerging problems and works to reduce obstacles to rapid and effective translation of\\nresearch into accessible technologies and services that improve human health.

DNA from all organisms is made up of the same chemical units (bases) called adenine,\\nthymine, guanine, and cytosine, abbreviated as A, T, G, and C. In complementary DNA strands,\\nA matches with T, and C with G, to form base pairs. The human genome (total composition of\\ngenetic material within a cell) is packaged into larger units known as chromosomes—physically\\nseparate molecules that range in length from about 50 to 250 million base pairs. Human cells\\ncontain two sets of chromosomes, one set inherited from each parent. Each cell normally\\ncontains 23 pairs of chromosomes, which consist of 22 autosomes (numbered 1 through 22) and\\none pair of sex chromosomes (XX or XY). However, sperm and ova normally contain half as\\nmuch genetic material: only one copy of each chromosome.\\nEach chromosome contains many genes, the basic physical and functional units of heredity.\\nGenes are specific sequences of bases that encode instructions for how to make proteins. The\\nDNA sequence is the particular side-by-side arrangement of bases along the DNA strand (e.g.,\\nATTCCGGA). Each gene has a unique DNA sequence. Genes comprise only about 29 percent\\nof the human genome; the remainder consists of non-coding regions, whose functions may\\ninclude providing chromosomal structural integrity and regulating where, when, and in what\\nquantity proteins are made. The human genome is estimated to contain 20,000 to 25,000 genes.\\nAlthough each cell contains a full complement of DNA, cells use genes selectively. For example, the\\ngenes active in a liver cell differ from the genes active in a brain cell because each cell performs different\\nfunctions and, therefore, requires different proteins. Different genes can also be activated during\\ndevelopment or in response to environmental stimuli such as an infection or stress.\\n1.2 Types of Genetic Disease\\nMany, if not most, diseases are caused or influenced by genetics. Genes, through the proteins\\nthey encode, determine how efficiently foods and chemicals are metabolized, how effectively\\ntoxins are detoxified, and how vigorously infections are targeted. Genetic diseases can be\\ncategorized into three major groups: single-gene, chromosomal, and multifactorial.\\nChanges in the DNA sequence of single genes, also known as mutations, cause thousands\\nof diseases. A gene can mutate in many ways, resulting in an altered protein product that\\nis unable to perform its normal function. The most common gene mutation involves a change\\nor “misspelling” in a single base in the DNA. Other mutations include the loss (deletion)\\nor gain (duplication or insertion) of a single or multiple base(s). The altered protein product\\nmay still retain some normal function, but at a reduced capacity. In other cases, the protein may\\nbe totally disabled by the mutation or gain an entirely new, but damaging, function. The\\noutcome of a particular mutation depends not only on how it alters a protein’s function, but\\nalso on how vital that particular protein is to survival. Other mutations, called polymorphisms,\\nare natural variations in DNA sequence that have no adverse effects and are simply differences\\namong individuals.\\nIn addition to mutations in single genes, genetic diseases can be caused by larger mutations in\\nchromosomes. Chromosomal abnormalities may result from either the total number of\\nchromosomes differing from the usual amount or the physical structure of a chromosome\\ndiffering from the usual structure. The most common type of chromosomal abnormality is'),\n",

A usual karyotype (complete chromosome set) contains 46 chromosomes\\nincluding an XX (female) or an XY (male) sex chromosome pair. Structural chromosomal\\nabnormalities include deletions, duplications, insertions, inversions, or translocations of a\\nchromosome segment. (See Appendix F for more information about chromosomal abnormalities.)\\nMultifactorial diseases are caused by a complex combination of genetic, behavioral, and\\nenvironmental factors. Examples of these conditions include spina bifida, diabetes, and heart\\ndisease. Although multifactorial diseases can recur in families, some mutations such as cancer\\ncan be acquired throughout an individual’s lifetime. All genes work in the context of\\nenvironment and behavior. Alterations in behavior or the environment such as diet, exercise,\\nexposure to toxic agents, or medications can all influence genetic traits.\\n1.3 Laws of Inheritance\\nThe basic laws of inheritance are useful in understanding patterns of disease transmission.\\nSingle-gene diseases are usually inherited in one of several patterns, depending on the location\\nof the gene (e.g., chromosomes 1-22 or X and Y) and whether one or two normal copies of\\nthe gene are needed for normal protein activity. Five basic modes of inheritance for single-gene\\ndiseases exist: autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, X-linked dominant, X-linked recessive,\\nand mitochondria.

Mutations and\\npolymorphisms are forms of genetic variation.\\nWhile mutations are generally associated with\\ndisease and are relatively rare, polymorphisms\\nare more frequent and their clinical significance\\nis not as straightforward.

Physical examination\\n2. Detailed medical family history\\n3. Clinical and laboratory testing, if appropriate\\nand available\\nAlthough primary care providers may not always be able to make\\na definitive diagnosis of a genetic disease, their role is critical in\\ncollecting a detailed family history, considering the possibility of\\na genetic disease in the differential diagnosis, ordering testing as\\nindicated, and when available, appropriately referring patients to\\ngenetic specialists.\\n2.2 Red Flags for Genetic Disease\\nSeveral factors indicate the possibility of a genetic disease in a\\ndifferential diagnosis. One major factor is the occurrence of a\\ncondition among family members that is disclosed when the family\\nhistory is obtained (see Chapter 3, Pedigree and Family History-taking ). The occurrence\\nof the same condition such as multiple miscarriages, stillbirths, or childhood deaths in more\\nthan one family member (particularly first-degree relatives) is suggestive of a genetic disease.\\nAdditionally, family history of common adult conditions (e.g., heart disease, cancer, and\\ndementia) that occur in two or more family members at relatively young ages may also suggest\\na genetic predisposition.\\nOther clinical symptoms suggestive of a genetic disease include developmental delay, mental\\nretardation, and congenital abnormalities. Dysmorphologies (unusual physical features), as well\\nas growth problems, can be suggestive of a genetic disorder. Although these clinical features may\\nbe caused by a number of factors, genetic conditions should be considered as part of the\\ndifferential diagnosis, particularly if the patient expresses several clinical features together that\\nmight be indicative of a syndrome (e.g., mental retardation, distinct facial features, and a heart\\ndefect or heart defects). Some physical features such as wide-set or droopy eyes, flat face, short\\nfingers, and tall stature may appear unique or slightly different than the average. Even though\\nthese rare and seemingly mild features may not immediately be suggestive of a genetic disease to\\na primary care provider, an evaluation by a genetics specialist may be helpful in identifying the\\npresence of a genetic disease.\\nGenetic conditions should not be ruled out in adolescents or adults, though many genetic\\nconditions appear during childhood. Genetic diseases can remain undetected for several years\\nuntil an event such as puberty or pregnancy triggers the onset of symptoms or the accumulation\\nof toxic metabolites results in disease later in life.A N e w Yo r k – M i d - A t l a n t i c G u i d e f o r Pat i e n t s a n d H e a lt h P r o f e s s i o n a l s12\\nImage Credit: U.S. Department of\\nEnergy Human Genome Program,\\nwww.ornl.gov/hgmis.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/08. Understanding Genetics Autor Genetic Alliance.pdf', 'page': 14}, page_content='2.3 Uses of Genetic Testing\\nGenetic tests can be used for many different purposes, some of which are listed in Table 2.1.\\n•Newborn screening is the most widespread use of genetic testing. (See Chapter 4 for more\\ninformation about newborn screening.) Almost every newborn in the United States is screened\\nfor a number of genetic diseases. Early detection of these diseases can lead to interventions to\\nprevent the onset of symptoms or minimize disease severity.\\n•Carrier testing can be used to help couples learn if they carry—and\\nthus risk passing to their children—an allele (variant form of the\\nsame gene) for a recessive condition such as cystic fibrosis, sickle cell\\nanemia, or Tay-Sachs disease. This type of testing is typically offered\\nto individuals who have a family history of a genetic disorder or\\npeople in ethnic groups with an increased risk of specific genetic\\nconditions. If both parents are tested, the test can provide\\ninformation about a couple’s chance of having a child with a specific\\ngenetic condition.\\n•Prenatal diagnostic testing is used to detect changes in a fetus’ genes or chromosomes. This\\ntype of testing is offered to couples with an increased risk of having a baby with a genetic or\\nchromosomal disorder. A tissue sample for testing can be obtained through amniocentesis or\\nchorionic villus sampling (see Appendix H ).\\n• Genetic tests may be used to confirm a diagnosis in a symptomatic individual or used to\\nmonitor prognosis of a disease or response to treatment (see Appendix G ).\\n•Predictive or predispositional testing can identify individuals at risk of getting a disease prior\\nto the onset of symptoms. These tests are particularly useful if an individual has a family\\nhistory of a specific disease and an intervention is available to prevent the onset of disease\\nor minimize disease severity. Predictive testing can identify mutations that increase a person’s\\nrisk of developing conditions with a genetic basis such as certain types of cancer.\\n2.4 Types of Genetic Testing\\nSeveral different methods are currently used in genetic testing laboratories. The type of test will\\ndepend on the type of abnormality being measured. In general, three major types of genetic\\ntesting are available: cytogenetic, biochemical, and molecular.\\n2.4.1 Cytogenetic T esting. Cytogenetics involves the examination of whole chromosomes for\\nabnormalities. Chromosomes of a dividing human cell can be analyzed clearly under a\\nmicroscope. White blood cells, specifically T lymphocytes, are the most readily accessible cells\\nfor cytogenetic analysis because they are easily collected from blood and are capable of rapid\\ndivision in cell culture. Cells from tissues such as bone marrow (for leukemia), amniotic fluid\\n(for prenatal diagnosis), and other tissue biopsies can also be cultured for cytogenetic analysis.\\nFollowing several days of cell culture, chromosomes are fixed, spread on microscope slides, and\\nthen stained. The staining methods for routine analysis allow each of the chromosomes to be\\nindividually identified.

The enormous numbers of biochemical reactions that routinely occur\\nin cells require different types of proteins. Several classes of proteins such as enzymes,\\ntransporters, structural proteins, regulatory proteins, receptors, and hormones exist to fulfill\\nmultiple functions. A mutation in any type of protein can result in disease if the mutation\\nresults in failure of the protein to function correctly. (See Table 2.2 for types of protein\\nalterations that may result in disease.)\\nClinical testing for a biochemical disease uses\\ntechniques that examine the protein instead of the gene.\\nTests can be developed to measure directly protein\\nactivity (enzymes), level of metabolites (indirect\\nmeasurement of protein activity), and the size or\\nquantity of protein (structural proteins). These tests\\nrequire a tissue sample in which the protein is present,\\ntypically blood, urine, amniotic fluid, or cerebrospinal\\nfluid. Since proteins are less stable than DNA and can\\ndegrade quickly, the sample must be collected, stored\\nproperly, and shipped promptly according to the\\nlaboratory’s specifications.\\n2.4.3 Molecular T esting. For small DNA mutations, direct DNA testing may be the most\\neffective method, particularly if the function of the protein is unknown and a biochemical test\\ncannot be developed. A DNA test can be performed on any tissue sample and requires very\\nsmall amounts of sample. Some genetic diseases can be caused by many different mutations,\\nmaking molecular testing challenging. For example, more than 1,000 mutations in the cystic\\nfibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene can cause cystic fibrosis (CF).\\nIt would be impractical to examine the entire sequence of the CFTR gene routinely to identify\\nthe causative mutation because the gene is quite large. However, since the majority of CF\\ncases are caused by approximately 30 mutations, this smaller group of mutations is tested before\\nmore comprehensive testing is performed.

Family\\nhistory can be used as a diagnostic tool and help\\nguide decisions about genetic testing for the\\npatient and at-risk family members. If a family is\\naffected by a disease, an accurate family history\\nwill be important to establish a pattern of\\ntransmission. A family history can also identify\\npotential health problems such as heart disease,\\ndiabetes, or cancer that an individual may be at\\nincreased risk for in the future. Early\\nidentification of increased risk may allow the\\nindividual and health professional to take steps\\nto reduce risk by implementing lifestyle changes,\\nintroducing medical interventions, and/or\\nincreasing disease surveillance.\\nAlthough providers may be familiar with\\nchildhood-onset genetic conditions, many complex, adult-onset conditions can also run in\\nfamilies. For example, about 5 to 10 percent of all breast cancers are hereditary. These cancers\\nmay be caused by mutations in particular genes such as BRCA1 or BRCA2. The U.S. Preventive\\nServices Task Force (USPSTF) recommends that doctors and patients be aware of family history\\npatterns associated with an increased risk for BRCA mutations.\\nAnother example of an adult-onset disease that can be inherited is Alzheimer’s disease. Although\\nmost Alzheimer’s disease cases are not seen in many consecutive generations, a small number of\\ncases are hereditary. Hereditary Alzheimer’s disease is an extremely aggressive form of the disease\\nand typically manifests before the age of 65. Three genes that cause early-onset Alzheimer’s\\ndisease have been identified to-date.\\nDespite the importance of family history in helping define occurrence of a genetic disorder\\nwithin a family, it should be noted that some genetic diseases—such as single-gene disorders like\\nDuchenne muscular dystrophy and hemophilia A, as well as most cases of Down syndrome,\\nchromosomal deletion syndromes, and other chromosomal disorders—are caused by\\nspontaneous mutations. Therefore, a genetic disorder cannot be ruled out in the absence of a\\nfamily history.A N e w Yo r k – M i d - A t l a n t i c G u i d e f o r Pat i e n t s a n d H e a lt h P r o f e s s i o n a l s16\\n'),\n",

Babies with any of these\\nconditions may look healthy at birth; but, if left\\nuntreated, these conditions can cause health problems\\nsuch as mental retardation, slow growth, and even\\ndeath. These outcomes may be prevented with\\ntreatment and long-term follow-up.\\nNewborn screening programs began in the U.S. in the\\n1960s with the work of Dr. Robert Guthrie, who\\ndeveloped a screening test for phenylketonuria (PKU).\\nPKU is an inherited metabolic disease caused by a\\nmutation of the gene for an enzyme responsible for\\nmetabolism of the amino acid phenylalanine. Children\\nwho are identified early can avoid foods with\\nphenylalanine, thereby avoiding buildup of the amino acid, which would otherwise lead to\\nbrain damage and mental retardation. When Dr. Guthrie introduced a system for collecting\\nand transporting blood samples on filter paper, cost-effective, wide-scale genetic screening\\nbecame possible.\\n4.1.1 Screening Procedure and Follow-up. A nurse or other medical professional takes a few drops\\nof blood from the baby’s heel. The blood should be drawn after the baby is 24 hours old, but\\nbefore the baby leaves the hospital. This blood sample is sent to a newborn screening laboratory.\\nThe baby’s doctor contacts the parent(s) if the results are not in normal range for any of the\\nscreened conditions. If this scenario occurs, follow-up testing may be required.\\n4.1.2 Retesting. Sometimes a baby must be screened again. This does not necessarily mean that a\\nmedical condition is present. Retesting may need to be done if:\\n• The blood sample was taken before the baby was 24 hours old\\n• A problem occurred with the way the blood sample was taken\\n• The first test showed risk of a possible medical condition\\nThe baby’s doctor or the state’s newborn screening program will contact the parent(s) if retesting\\nis necessary. It is important to get this testing done right away.\\n4.1.3 Clinical Evaluation and Diagnostic T esting. Occasionally, the results of the newborn screen\\nstrongly suggest that the infant has one of the conditions. The newborn screening program\\nnotifies one of four specialty-care centers, depending on which test was abnormal. The\\nspecialties are metabolic, cystic fibrosis, endocrine, and hematology. The parents will be notified\\nby the newborn screening program, the primary physician, the hospital of birth, or the specialty-\\ncare center, depending on the newborn screening program’s protocol. If this happens, it is\\nextremely important that the parents bring their child to the specialist as soon as possible,\\nsometimes that very day, for further evaluation and laboratory testing.\\n4.1.4 Treatment. The treatment for each condition is different and may include a special diet,\\nhormones, and/or medications.

Social and ethical issues are also included in the decision-making\\nprocess. Increasingly, tandem mass spectrometry is being used for newborn screening. This\\ntechnology is capable of screening for over 50 metabolic conditions from dried blood-spot\\nspecimens. In 1999, the American College of Medical Genetics released a report commissioned\\nby the U.S. Health Resources and Services Administration recommending a uniform screening\\npanel of 29 genetic conditions.

When hearing loss goes\\nundetected, even for just a year or two,\\nserious delays in speech and language can\\nresult. When hearing loss is discovered in\\ninfancy, treatment can be started early\\nenough to prevent or lessen these delays.\\n4.3.1 Screening Procedure. Babies are\\nusually screened in the first few days of\\nlife, before they are discharged from the\\nhospital. The screen, which is quick and\\npainless, is done by one of two methods: otoacoustic emissions (OAE) or automatic brainstem\\nresponse (ABR). Both of these methods involve placing tiny earplugs in the ear canals or\\nearphones on the ears and using a computer to measure the baby’s reactions to sound. The OAE\\ntest measures how the baby’s inner ear responds to sound, and the ABR test measures how the\\nbrain responds to sound. Typically, testing is done when the baby is asleep and unaware of the\\ntesting. Passing the hearing screening indicates that the baby’s hearing is within the normal range\\nat the time of the test. However, some babies with a family history of hearing loss, repeated ear\\ninfections, or serious illness may develop hearing loss later. The child’s hearing and speech\\nshould be monitored as he or she grows.\\n4.3.2 Retesting. Babies who do not pass the first screening are retested and may be referred\\nto an audiologist (hearing specialist). The second screening should occur while the baby is still\\nin the hospital or within two weeks after leaving the hospital. If the baby does not pass the\\ninitial hearing screening, it does not mean that the baby has permanent hearing loss since most\\nbabies who do not pass the first hearing screening pass the second screening. Often, babies can\\nhave fluid, blockage, or debris in the ear that clears naturally. If further testing shows that a baby\\nhas hearing loss, an audiologist along with an ear, nose, and throat specialist can best determine\\nthe next steps.\\n4.3.3 Treatment. T reatment will depend on the type and degree of hearing loss. If hearing\\nloss is permanent, treatment options include hearing aids, cochlear implants, or early\\nintervention services.A N e w Yo r k – M i d - A t l a n t i c G u i d e f o r Pat i e n t s a n d H e a lt h P r o f e s s i o n a l s22\\nVirginia\\nVirginia Department of Health\\nDivision of Child and Adolescent Health\\nPediatric Screening and Genetic Services\\n109 Governor Street, 8thFloor\\nRichmond, VA 23219\\nPh: 804.864.7712\\nwww.vahealth.org/geneticsWest Virginia\\nWest Virginia Department of Health and\\nHuman Resources\\nOffice of Maternal, Child, and Family Health\\nNewborn Metabolic Screening Program\\n350 Capitol Street, Room 427\\nCharleston, WV 25301\\nPh: 304.558.5388\\nwww.wvdhhr.org/nbms\\n'),\n",

Some\\npeople believe that genetic information is uniquely sensitive because of its predictive nature and\\npotential implications for other family members; therefore, it raises unique social issues. This\\nbelief has translated to specific policy positions to protect genetic information and prevent it\\nfrom becoming part of a patient’s medical record. Others believe that genetic information is like\\nother medical information, and the same protections and high standards of privacy and\\nconfidentiality should apply to all personal medical information. In fact, they believe that\\ntreating genetic information differently from other medical information may result in\\nunintended disparities.\\nRegardless, both genetic and non-genetic medical information:\\n• Have the potential to help or harm patients and must be considered in making patient\\ncare decisions\\n• Are complex and demands thoughtful, critical communication of risks and uncertainties\\n• Will arise in your practice; it is helpful to think through how you will respond in the\\nface of inevitable questions, some of them involving difficult decisions\\nConcerns that may be specific to genetic information:\\n• Provides information about family members and relatives; disclosure of genetic\\ninformation often directly impacts other family members\\n• Can lead to breaches of confidentiality that must be considered and addressed proactively\\n7.2 A Lifetime of Affected Relationships\\nGenetic conditions have powerful effects on families.

Every family\\nis different, and it is difficult to predict how people will react to a genetic diagnosis. It is\\nhelpful to think in advance about some of the possible reactions so you can be prepared and\\nminimize distress.\\n7.3.1 Patients. A genetic diagnosis can provide a great benefit to patients. When the condition\\nis rare and patients and families spend years without knowing its name or cause, a diagnosis\\ncan help make sense of the situation. Diagnoses can lead to improved treatment options and\\naccess to support services. They can also help other family members make decisions about\\ntheir own lives.\\nA genetic diagnosis may lead to negative reactions, too. A common response is that the science\\nof genetics is confusing and frustrating. Patients identified with a genetic diagnosis may consider\\nthemselves at fault or “broken” or interpret their diagnosis as leading to something they cannot\\nhandle. A genetic diagnosis can lead to concerns about stigmatization.\\nThe reaction to a diagnosis varies from individual to individual and is affected by many factors\\nincluding age, gender, education, religion, and culture. Providers should be aware of these\\ndifferences and understand the patient’s background in order to communicate effectively.\\n7.3.2 Parents. Understandably, diagnosis of a genetic condition may put stress on a relationship.\\nCouples with an affected child often face difficult family-planning decisions because future\\nchildren may have a chance of inheriting the condition. Depending on the condition, parents\\nmay also be faced with hard choices regarding prenatal testing and termination of a pregnancy.\\nThe magnitude of these decisions and their outcomes impacts both individuals and relationships.\\nParents may experience guilt due to the hereditary nature of genetic conditions.\\n7.3.3 Family. Given the shared nature of genetic information, it is important to consider the\\nfamily unit. Unaffected family members should not be forgotten in the case of a genetic disorder.\\nWhen one family member is diagnosed with a disease, family members who do not have the\\ndisease often feel guilt that loved ones are affected when they are not. For adult-onset diseases,\\nunaffected spouses may view their partners differently. The diagnosis can lead to a breakdown in\\ncommunication. Siblings of children with special needs sometimes feel neglected because parents\\nmay focus more time and effort on the siblings affected by a genetic condition. Including\\nunaffected family members in the care of individuals with special needs can help them examine\\ntheir own emotional issues. Adults who are diagnosed with a genetic condition and are\\nconsidering having a child may need to consider the chance of having an affected child, as well\\nas their ability to care for the child.\\nIn cases where a genetic test is predictive, other family members may misinterpret the results as a\\ndiagnosis rather than an indicator of risk for a condition. It is important to keep in mind that\\ngenetic test results are often complex and may be difficult for patients and their families to\\nunderstand. In some cases, a genetic test may reveal the risk status of other family members who\\nmay not wish to know this information, potentially encroaching upon their autonomy or privacy.'),\n",

A family already struggling financially may be intimidated by the costs associated\\nwith caring for a child with special needs. Referrals to appropriate support services are crucial\\nto help ease the stress caused by a genetic diagnosis. Advocacy groups, state health departments,\\nand The Patient Advocate Foundation are all organizations that may provide a starting point\\nfor support services.\\nIn general, support or advocacy groups and community resources can provide ongoing support\\nto patients and their families with genetic conditions. Support groups provide a forum for\\nsharing experiences about caring for a family member affected with a genetic condition, coping\\nwith a new diagnosis, obtaining healthcare or other services, and healing. Members of support\\ngroups know firsthand what it means to be faced with a diagnosis and need accurate, up-to-date\\ninformation. Staying connected with their community helps individuals fight the feelings of\\nisolation that often surround families living with a genetic condition.\\n7.3.4 Communities. Genetic testing can also affect the community at large. Genetics has been\\nused in the past to stigmatize and discriminate along ethnic or racial lines, and underserved or\\nunderrepresented communities often view genetic research and services with distrust. They may\\nfeel that the results of a genetic test, including newborn screening, will be used to segregate their\\ncommunities. These fears often work in combination with other difficulties, including\\navailability of services and health insurance, communication, and cultural barriers, when\\nnavigating the medical system.\\nSome communities do not see their condition as a disability, but rather as one aspect of their\\nlifestyle. For example, members of the deaf community may oppose hearing tests for this reason.\\nIn general, it is a good idea to understand the communities to which your patients belong so\\nyou can present information and options in ways that promote trust.\\n7.4 Coping Mechanisms\\nWhen a newborn is diagnosed with a genetic\\ncondition, parents may be overcome with\\nconcern for their child. Some common\\nreactions include fear, confusion, and grief\\nthat their child is not “normal,” guilt that\\nthey did something to cause the condition,\\nanger at the lack of a solution, or the belief\\nthat the other parent is to blame.\\nThe fact that a medical cure or treatment\\nmay not exist often comes as a great surprise\\nto parents.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/08. Understanding Genetics Autor Genetic Alliance.pdf', 'page': 41}, page_content='8.1 Description of Ethical, Legal, and Social Issues\\nTo protect patients from additional distress, healthcare providers should be aware of the relevant\\nethical, legal, and social issues related to genetics in healthcare. Genetic specialists may be able to\\naddress specific patient concerns and questions regarding these issues.\\n8.1.1 Communicating T est Results. It is critical that genetic test results are discussed with patients\\nin an understandable and compassionate manner. As many genetic tests will not provide simple\\npositive/negative results, but potentially inconclusive results or risk estimates, it is important that\\npatients understand the extent of the information actually provided from a genetic test. Results\\nshould be released only to those individuals for whom the test recipient has given consent. The\\nmethod of communication should be chosen in advance (for example, by phone or in person) to\\nminimize the likelihood that results will be shared with unauthorized persons or organizations.\\nUnder no circumstances should results with personal identifiers be provided to any outside\\nparties, including employers, insurers, or government agencies, without the test recipient’s\\nwritten consent.\\n8.1.2 Direct-to-consumer T ests. A number of companies offer genetic tests directly to consumers\\nwithout requiring physician involvement. Patients should be cautious when considering direct-\\nto-consumer genetic testing and are encouraged to discuss this option with their healthcare\\nprofessional. Some of these companies may play off consumer fears, offer tests with little clinical\\nutility, or not be properly certified or licensed.\\n8.1.3 Duty to Disclose. The results of a genetic test may have implications for a patient’s family\\nmembers. However, healthcare providers have an obligation to the person being tested not to\\ninform other family members without the permission of the person tested, except in extreme\\ncircumstances. If a health professional believes family members may be at risk, the patient may\\nbe encouraged to discuss test results with other family members. In general, families are opposed\\nto doctors informing at-risk members without their consent, even in cases where the disease is\\neasily preventable. The duty to inform varies by state, and courts have ruled differently in\\nresponse to distinct cases.\\nThe American Society of Human Genetics suggests that disclosure to at-risk individuals is\\npermissible when the following criteria are met:\\n• Attempts to encourage disclosure on the part of the patient have failed\\n• Harm is highly likely, serious, imminent, and foreseeable\\n• At-risk relatives are identifiable\\n• Disease is preventable or medically accepted standards for treatment or screening\\nare available\\n• Harm from failing to disclose outweighs the harm from disclosure\\n8.1.4 Genetic Discrimination. When considering genetic testing, the potential for discrimination\\nbased on genetic information is a major concern often raised. This fear can impact an\\nindividual’s decision to utilize genetic testing services. Since genetic test results are typically\\nincluded in an individual’s medical record, people should be aware that the results could be\\naccessible to others.\\nOn May 21, 2008, President Bush signed the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act\\n(GINA) into law. As the first major new civil rights bill of the new century, GINA protects\\nindividuals from discrimination on the basis of genetic information in health insurance andA N e w Yo r k – M i d - A t l a n t i c G u i d e f o r Pat i e n t s a n d H e a lt h P r o f e s s i o n a l s40\\n'),\n",

The health insurance provisions of the law take effect 12 months after the date of\\nsigning, in May 2009, and the employment protections take effect 18 months after the date of\\nsignage, in November 2009.\\nIn summary, GINA prevents health insurers from denying coverage or adjusting premiums on\\nthe basis of genetic information or requesting that an individual undergo a genetic test. Similarly,\\nemployers are prohibited from using genetic information to make hiring, firing, or promotion\\ndecisions. The law also limits an employer’s right to request, require, or purchase an employee’s\\ngenetic information. GINA does not apply to life, disability, or long-term care insurance. Before\\nthe federal protections of GINA, more than 40 states established legislation prohibiting genetic\\ndiscrimination. However, the scope of these protections differs from state to state. GINA does\\nnot overturn broader protections provided in some state regulations.\\nIn addition to fears of discrimination in employment and health insurance, members of some\\ncommunities often fear that genetic information will be used to stigmatize them. Healthcare\\nproviders should be sensitive to the fact that some groups may distrust the use of genetics as a\\nhealth tool.\\n8.1.5 Informed Consent. To help ensure that patients understand the risks and benefits of\\nhealthcare choices, informed consent is an important part of the medical decision-making\\nprocess. For patients considering genetic testing, the following items should be carefully\\ndiscussed and understood before consent is obtained:\\n• Risks, limitations, and benefits of testing or not testing\\n• Alternatives to genetic testing\\n• Details of the testing process (e.g., what type of sample is required, accuracy of test, and\\nturn-around time)\\n• Privacy/confidentiality of test results\\n• The voluntary nature of testing\\n• Potential consequences related to results, including: (1) impact on health; (2) emotional\\nand psychological reactions; (3) treatment/prevention options; and (4) ramifications for\\nthe family\\n8.1.6 Privacy. Genetic information has enormous implications for the individual and the family. The\\nprivacy of that information is a major concern to patients—in particular, who should have or needs\\naccess to that information. T o protect personal genetic information and avoid its inclusion in a patient’s\\nmedical record, some patients pay for genetic testing out-of-pocket.\\n8.1.7 Psychosocial Impact. Every individual will respond differently to news of his/her genetic test\\nresults, whether negative or positive. As there is no right or wrong response, healthcare\\nprofessionals should refrain from judgment and help the patient understand the test results with\\nrespect to his/her own health, available interventions or follow-up, and risks to his/her family.\\nAn individual may respond to genetic information on several levels: individual, family, or\\ncommunity and society. Referrals to genetic counselors, psychologists, or social workers should\\nbe made as needed.\\n8.1.8 Reproductive Issues. Genetic information is routinely used to inform reproductive decisions\\nand medical care. Risk factors for genetic conditions for which preconception or prenatal genetic\\ntesting may be considered include advanced maternal age, family history, multiple miscarriages,\\nand drug and alcohol exposure. As these procedures carry risks and benefits, parents should\\ncarefully consider and discuss these options with a physician or genetic counselor. Providers\\nshould take a nondirective stance and support the patients’ decisions.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/08. Understanding Genetics Autor Genetic Alliance.pdf', 'page': 43}, page_content='8.1.9 Societal Values. Genetic information can raise questions about personal responsibility,\\npersonal choice versus genetic determinism/fate, and concepts of health and disease. Personal\\nfactors, family values, and community and cultural beliefs will influence responses to these\\nissues. Genetic information may influence one individual to change his or her lifestyle or\\nbehavior to reduce risk or disease severity; whereas, others may choose to respond differently.\\nHealth professionals should be respectful and sensitive to cultural and societal values and work\\nwith the patient to define the appropriate course of action for him/her with respect to genetic\\ntesting and follow-up care.\\n8.1.10 T est Utility. The useful application of genetic tests will depend on the correct\\ninterpretation of test results and their utility in guiding medical care and treatment. However,\\nfor some genetic conditions, the utility of genetic test results may be limited if treatment is\\nunavailable or the results are inconclusive. These issues should be discussed with patients or\\nparents of patients when a genetic test is being considered. Even if a test is not considered to be\\nmedically useful, a patient or the family may still benefit from testing. Clinical guidelines should\\nbe consulted for recommended follow-up care and treatment.\\n8.1.11 T est Validity. Several issues regarding test validity should be considered prior to ordering a\\ngenetic test. The analytical and clinical validity of a test are generally measured as test specificity,\\nsensitivity, and predictive value. This information should be shared with the patient as he or she\\nconsiders whether or not testing is appropriate for him/her. Because most genetic tests are\\noffered as services, they are not approved by the Food and Drug Administration. However,\\ngenetic tests (or any other clinical laboratory test) should only be ordered from laboratories\\ncertified by Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) or another governmental\\ncertifying entity.\\nSelected References\\nAmerican Medical Association. \"Why physicians should know the legal and ethical issues\\nraised by genetic information and technology.\" Genethics. 2000.\\nAmerican Society of Human Genetics.

What an inspiration she was!\\nMost people don’t know that men can get breast cancer too. Dad discovered his breast cancer in\\n2001. While showering, he felt a lump in his left breast/chest area. His doctor confirmed it was\\nsuspicious. Dad had a mammogram and then a mastectomy to get rid of the cancer. Shortly\\nafter, he was diagnosed with prostate cancer and underwent 40 radiation treatments over eight\\nweeks. His cancers of the breast and prostate were genetically linked. Within a few years, he was\\ndiagnosed with bladder cancer. Fortunately, this was caught early and removed, and from that\\npoint on he has been cancer free. My dad is now 78 years old and going strong.\\nAfter my dad’s cancers, his oncologist tested him for the BRCA2 gene mutation and discovered\\nhe was positive as a carrier. My siblings and I were tested to see if we were carriers too. I was\\npositive for BRCA2, which carries up to an 85 percent lifetime risk of breast cancer for women.\\nThe oncologist gave me valuable suggestions. He directed me to support groups, where I found\\ngood answers to the many questions I had about my risks and options. I researched my options\\nand, based on my BRCA risk, decided to have a bilateral mastectomy with immediate\\nreconstruction. I selected two amazing plastic surgeons to perform DIEP , an advanced\\nreconstruction procedure that, without implants, leaves a woman’s breasts whole, made of my\\nown soft, warm, living tissue. I do not feel as if I lost my breasts…only my risk of breast cancer.\\nMy breast surgeon said to consider myself cured. I still have regular breast exams, although my\\nchance of having breast cancer is now 1 to 2 percent, which is lower than the general\\npopulation’s 8 to 12 percent risk. I am satisfied that I have now done all I can to prevent cancer.\\nLooking back over my family’s history, I am reminded that we are a tough bunch—survivors and\\nco-survivors all. Thanks to medical research advances, the future of my children, and all BRCA\\nmutation carriers is bright.\\n9.2 THE VALUE OF NEWBORN SCREENING\\nWe brought our 7lb., 5oz. baby boy home on April 14th. After a tiring but blissfully happy first\\nweek of 4 a.m. feedings and little sleep, our pediatrician called to say that one of the newborn\\nscreening tests done on the blood spot collected from our son at birth had come back positive.\\nMy husband and I both thought it had to be a mistake; our son Miguel was a completely\\nhealthy and happy baby boy.A N e w Yo r k – M i d - A t l a n t i c G u i d e f o r Pat i e n t s a n d H e a lt h P r o f e s s i o n a l s44\\n'),\n",

The following week, we took Miguel\\nback to the hospital to have him retested. The second test also came back positive. Without a\\ndoubt, Miguel had this disorder; though he still seemed completely healthy. The doctor told us\\nthat children with this rare genetic disorder are unable to break down excessive protein and for\\nMiguel to have a normal life, he would have to be put on a special low-protein diet. I had so\\nmany questions about what would happen to Miguel. How different would he be from other\\nchildren? Would his development be delayed? Would he be able to walk and talk and go to\\nschool with other kids?\\nAfter talking with other parents of children with homocystinuria, several pediatricians, a\\ngeneticist at a medical center two hours away, and nutritionists, we gained some confidence that\\nwe could take care of Miguel and provide him with a normal childhood. Miguel has been on a\\nlow-protein diet for almost 10 years now, and his disease is under control. He is in the 5thgrade\\nand is a very active, bright child. He is doing well in school, plays soccer and baseball, and does\\nall of the things any 10-year-old would do: birthday parties, Little League, and Boy Scouts. Since\\nMiguel’s condition was detected at such an early age, we were able to adjust his diet and prevent\\nsymptoms from developing.\\n9.3 HEREDITARY HEMACHROMATOSIS\\nGrowing up, I was busy and energetic like everyone else. I rarely visited the doctor and had no\\nhint of any chronic medical problem.\\nSoon after I turned 40, I started to notice my joints were achy. But I figured I was just getting\\nold. About a year later, I just wasn’t feeling as well as I thought I should. I was always tired and\\nhad occasional abdominal pain. I saw my doctor for a routine physical. After a long series of\\ntests and visits with specialists, a blood test revealed that I had unusually high levels of iron. A\\nliver biopsy confirmed that I have hereditary hemochromatosis.\\nTo understand my own health risks and the chances of my relatives developing this condition,\\nI met with a genetic counselor and had a genetic test performed. After meeting with the genetic\\ncounselor and doing my own research, I am beginning to understand what it means to have\\nhereditary hemochromatosis. I now know that hereditary hemochromatosis is a fairly common\\nadult-onset condition that can be associated with many serious complications, including heart\\nproblems, diabetes, cirrhosis of the liver, and arthritis. I consider myself lucky to have been\\ndiagnosed at a relatively young age, before any of the major complications developed. I now\\nhave periodic phlebotomies (a procedure similar to donating blood) to keep the iron from\\naccumulating in my body and damaging my organs. This treatment should allow me to live a\\nlong, normal life.'),\n",

I had a recurrent skin infection\\nfor almost a year, but it seemed minor at first. And I had no health insurance, so I put off\\nseeing a doctor. Eventually I noticed that I always felt thirsty, despite drinking plenty of water\\nand other beverages. In spite of my increased drinking habits and normal appetite, I somehow\\nlost 40 pounds. Finally, my discomfort from the skin condition became so severe that I went to\\nthe emergency room, where I was diagnosed with Type II diabetes. Apparently, I had actually\\nhad this condition for some time.\\nSince my diagnosis, I have learned a lot about my family and Type II diabetes. I now understand\\nthat Type II diabetes appears to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental\\nfactors. My increased risk for diabetes should have been noted many years earlier. If my doctor\\nand I had been aware that my grandfather, mother, and two cousins have diabetes, we could have\\nrealized my risk was greater than that of someone without a family history.\\nAdditionally, it would have been helpful to know that my love of sweets and fatty foods and my\\ntendency to be overweight further increased my risk. Being aware of my risk factors might have\\nprompted me to monitor my health more carefully. I could have exercised more and modified\\nmy diet, which might have prevented or delayed the onset of my condition or perhaps made it\\nless severe. Also, I might have acted more quickly when I recognized the symptoms of diabetes.\\nKnowing about your family history can help you to recognize your risk for a condition and\\npossibly enable you to take action to avoid or delay its development.'),\n",

Many different types of cells have different functions. They\\nmake up all of your body’s organs and tissues. Nearly every cell in a person’s body has the same\\ndeoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA. DNA is the hereditary material in humans and almost all other\\norganisms. Most DNA is located in the cell nucleus (where it is called nuclear DNA), but a small\\namount of DNA can also be found in the mitochondria (where it is called mitochondrial DNA).\\nDNA contains the code for building and maintaining an organism. The code is spelled out in\\nthe order, or sequence, of four chemical bases—adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and\\nthymine (T)—in the same way that letters of the alphabet come together to form words,\\nsentences, and paragraphs. Human DNA consists of about three billion bases, and more than 99\\npercent of those bases are the same in all people.\\nDNA bases pair with each other—A with T, C with G—to form units called base pairs. Each\\nbase is attached to a sugar molecule and a phosphate molecule. Together, base, sugar, and\\nphosphate are called a nucleotide. Nucleotides are arranged in two long strands that form a\\nspiral called a double helix. The structure of the double helix is like a ladder, with base pairs\\nrunning through the middle like rungs and sugar and phosphate molecules along the outside.\\nGenes are small sections of the long chain of DNA. They are the basic physical and functional\\nunits of heredity. In humans, genes vary in size from a few hundred DNA bases to more than\\ntwo million bases. The Human Genome Project has estimated that humans have between\\n20,000 and 25,000 genes. Every person has two copies of each gene, one inherited from each\\nparent. Most genes are the same in all people, but a small number of genes (less than one\\npercent of the total) are slightly different between people. Alleles are forms of the same gene\\nwith small differences in their sequence of DNA bases. These small differences contribute to\\neach person’s unique features.\\nGenes act as instructions to make\\nmolecules called proteins. To function\\ncorrectly, each cell depends on\\nthousands of proteins to do their jobs\\nin the right places at the right times.\\nSometimes changes in a gene, called\\nmutations, prevent one or more of\\nthese proteins from working properly.\\nThis may cause cells or organs to\\nchange or lose their function, which\\ncan lead to a disease. Mutations,\\nrather than genes themselves, cause\\ndisease. For example, when people say\\nthat someone has “the cystic fibrosis\\ngene,” they are usually referring to a\\nmutated version of the CFTR gene, which causes the disease. All people, including those\\nwithout cystic fibrosis, have a version of the CFTR gene.Appendix A. Basic Genetics Information\\n'),\n",

Everyone\\ncan recognize traits such as curly hair, dimples, leanness, or athletic ability that run in their\\nfamilies. Risks for diseases such as asthma, diabetes, cancer, and heart disease also run in\\nfamilies. Everyone’s family history of disease is different. The key features of a family history that\\nmay increase risk are:\\n• Diseases that occur at an earlier age than expected (10 to 20 years before most people\\nget the disease)\\n• Disease in more than one close relative\\n• Disease that does not usually affect a certain gender (for example, breast cancer in a male)\\n• Certain combinations of diseases within a family (for example, breast and ovarian\\ncancer, or heart disease and diabetes)\\nIf your family has one or more of these features, your family history may hold important\\nclues about your risk for disease. People with a family history of disease may have the most\\nto gain from lifestyle changes and screening tests. You cannot change your genes, but you\\ncan change unhealthy behaviors such as smoking, inactivity, and poor eating habits. In many\\ncases, adopting a healthier lifestyle can reduce your risk for diseases that run in your family.\\nScreening tests (such as mammograms and colorectal cancer screening) can detect diseases like\\ncancer at an early stage, when they are most treatable. Screening tests can also detect disease\\nrisk factors like high cholesterol and high blood pressure, which can be treated to reduce the\\nchances of getting a disease.\\nLearning About Your Family History\\nTo learn about your family history:\\n• Ask questions\\n• Talk at family gatherings\\n• Look at death certificates and family medical records, if possibleA N e w Yo r k – M i d - A t l a n t i c G u i d e f o r Pat i e n t s a n d H e a lt h P r o f e s s i o n a l s64\\nAppendix B.

An accurate family health history is a valuable tool to illustrate how\\nconditions are passed down through generations.\\nA person has two copies of almost every gene, one copy from mom and one copy from dad.\\nScientists have studied human genes to learn how they normally work and how changes in genes\\ncan change how they work. Some changes are very minor and do not affect the way a gene works.\\nThese changes are often called single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs, pronounced “snips”) or\\ngene variants. Other changes, called mutations, affect how a gene works and can lead to disease.\\nFor some conditions, family members with the same mutation may not have the same symptoms.\\nFor other conditions, individuals with different mutations can have similar characteristics. This is\\nbecause gene expression is influenced by genes, as well as by the environment.\\nDiseases caused by mutations in a single gene are usually inherited in a simple pattern,\\ndepending on the location of the gene and whether one or two normal copies of the gene are\\nneeded. This is often referred to as Mendelian inheritance because Gregor Mendel first observed\\nthese patterns in garden pea plants. Most single gene disorders are rare; but, in total, they affect\\nmillions of people in the United States.\\nSeveral basic modes of inheritance exist for single-gene disorders: autosomal dominant,\\nautosomal recessive, X-linked dominant, and X-linked recessive. However, not all genetic\\nconditions will follow these patterns, and other rare forms of inheritance such as mitochondrial\\ninheritance exist. (See table at the end of this section.)\\nDominant mutations are expressed when only one copy of that mutation is present. Therefore,\\nanyone who inherits one dominant disease mutation such as the mutation for Huntington’s\\ndisease will have that disease. Dominantly inherited genetic diseases tend to occur in every\\ngeneration of a family. Each affected person usually has one affected parent. However, dominant\\nmutations can also happen in an individual for the first time, with no family history of the\\ncondition (spontaneous mutation).\\nRecessive mutations require two mutated copies for disease to develop. Recessive genetic diseases\\nare typically not seen in every generation of an affected family. The parents of an affected person\\nare generally carriers: unaffected people who have a copy of a mutated gene. If both parents are\\ncarriers of the same mutated gene and both pass it to the child, the child will be affected.\\nInheritance patterns differ for genes on sex chromosomes (chromosomes X and Y) compared\\nto genes located on autosomes, non-sex chromosomes (chromosomes numbers 1-22). This is\\ndue to the fact that, in general, females carry two X chromosomes (XX), while males carry one\\nX and one Y chromosome (XY). Therefore, females carry two copies of each X-linked gene, but\\nmales carry only one copy each of X-linked and Y-linked genes. Females carry no copies of\\nY-linked genes.A N e w Yo r k – M i d - A t l a n t i c G u i d e f o r Pat i e n t s a n d H e a lt h P r o f e s s i o n a l s70\\nAppendix E.

Since males only have one X chromosome, any mutated gene on\\nthe X chromosome, dominant or recessive, will result in disease. Because females have two\\ncopies of X-linked genes, they will not be affected by inheriting of a single recessive mutation on\\nan X-linked gene. For X-linked recessive diseases to occur in females, both copies of the gene\\nmust be mutated. Families with an X-linked recessive disorder often have affected males, but\\nrarely affected females, in each generation.\\nFor X-linked dominant diseases, however, a mutation in one copy of an X-linked gene will result\\nin disease for both males and females. Families with an X-linked dominant disorder often have\\nboth affected males and affected females in each generation.\\nA striking characteristic of X-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass X-linked traits to\\ntheir sons; fathers only pass X chromosomes to their daughters and Y chromosomes to their\\nsons.

Half\\nof the chromosomes come from our mother, and the other half come from our father. The first 22\\npairs are called autosomes. The 23rdpair consists of the sex chromosomes, X and Y. Females usually\\nhave two X chromosomes, and males usually have one X and one Y chromosome in each cell. All of\\nthe information that the body needs to grow and develop comes from the chromosomes. Each\\nchromosome contains thousands of genes, which make proteins that direct the body’s development,\\ngrowth, and chemical reactions.\\nMany types of chromosomal abnormalities exist, but they can be categorized as either numerical or\\nstructural. Numerical abnormalities are whole chromosomes either missing from or extra to the normal\\npair. Structural abnormalities are when part of an individual chromosome is missing, extra, switched to\\nanother chromosome, or turned upside down.\\nChromosomal abnormalities can occur as an accident when the egg or the sperm is formed or\\nduring the early developmental stages of the fetus. The age of the mother and certain environmental\\nfactors may play a role in the occurrence of genetic errors. Prenatal screening and testing can be\\nperformed to examine the chromosomes of the fetus and detect some, but not all, types of\\nchromosomal abnormalities.\\nChromosomal abnormalities can have many different effects, depending on the specific abnormality.\\nFor example, an extra copy of chromosome 21 causes Down syndrome (trisomy 21). Chromosomal\\nabnormalities can also cause miscarriage, disease, or problems in growth\\nor development.\\nThe most common type of chromosomal abnormality is known as aneuploidy, an abnormal\\nchromosome number due to an extra or missing chromosome. Most people with aneuploidy have\\ntrisomy (three copies of a chromosome) instead of monosomy (single copy of a chromosome). Down\\nsyndrome is probably the most well-known example of a chromosomal aneuploidy. Besides trisomy 21,\\nthe major chromosomal aneuploidies seen in live-born babies are: trisomy 18; trisomy 13; 45, X\\n(T urner syndrome); 47, XXY (Klinefelter syndrome); 47, XYY; and 47, XXX.\\nStructural chromosomal abnormalities result from breakage and incorrect rejoining of chromosomal\\nsegments. A range of structural chromosomal abnormalities result in disease. Structural\\nrearrangements are defined as balanced if the complete chromosomal set is still present, though\\nrearranged, and unbalanced if information is additional or missing. Unbalanced rearrangements\\ninclude deletions, duplications, or insertions of a chromosomal segment. Ring chromosomes can\\nresult when a chromosome undergoes two breaks and the broken ends fuse into a circular\\nchromosome. An isochromosome can form when an arm of the chromosome is missing and the\\nremaining arm duplicates.\\nBalanced rearrangements include inverted or translocated chromosomal regions. Since the full\\ncomplement of DNA material is still present, balanced chromosomal rearrangements may go\\nundetected because they may not result in disease. A disease can arise as a result of a balanced\\nrearrangement if the breaks in the chromosomes occur in a gene, resulting in an absent or\\nnonfunctional protein, or if the fusion of chromosomal segments results in a hybrid of two genes,\\nproducing a new protein product whose function is damaging to the cell.A N e w Yo r k – M i d - A t l a n t i c G u i d e f o r Pat i e n t s a n d H e a lt h P r o f e s s i o n a l s72\\nAppendix F.

The information gained from\\ngenetic testing may be helpful in a number of ways such as diagnosing a genetic disease, starting\\ntreatment, or initiating prevention strategies, as well as making life decisions such as career choice and\\nfamily planning. Several types of genetic testing are available, and this appendix provides an overview of\\nthe genetic testing available, as well as who may be offered such testing.\\nWhy Genetic T esting?\\nGenetic testing may be offered for a number of different reasons including:\\n• T o confirm or rule out a diagnosis in an individual with symptoms of a genetic condition\\n• For individuals with a family history of or a previous child with a genetic condition\\n• T o locate possible genetic conditions in newborn babies so treatment may be\\nstarted immediately\\nHow Is Genetic T esting Performed?\\nGenetic testing involves analyzing an individual’s blood, skin, hair, or other body tissue to look at his or\\nher DNA, chromosomes, or proteins for a change, or mutation, that is associated with a genetic\\ncondition. When a mutation occurs, it may affect all or part of a gene and can result in an abnormal\\nfunction leading to disease. Three major types of genetic testing are available in laboratories: cytogenetic\\n(to examine whole chromosomes), biochemical (to measure protein produced by genes), and molecular\\n(to look for small DNA mutations). (See Chapter 2 andAppendix I for more information.)\\nWhat Types of Genetic T esting Are There?\\nNewborn screening is the most widespread use of genetic testing. (See Chapter 4 for more information\\nabout newborn screening.) Almost every newborn in the U.S. is screened for several genetic diseases.\\nEarly detection of these diseases can lead to interventions to prevent the onset of symptoms or\\nminimize disease severity.\\nCarrier testing can be used to help couples to learn if they carry—and thus risk passing to their\\nchildren—an allele for a recessive condition such as cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, and T ay-Sachs\\ndisease. This type of testing is typically offered to individuals who have a family history\\nof a genetic disorder and to people in ethnic groups with an increased risk of specific genetic\\nconditions. If both parents are tested, the test can provide information about a couple’s chance\\nof having a child with a genetic condition.\\nPrenatal diagnostic testing is used to detect changes in a fetus’ genes or chromosomes. This type of\\ntesting is offered to couples with an increased chance of having a baby with a genetic or chromosomal\\ndisorder.

Genetic\\ntesting may provide a diagnosis and help provide information for symptom management,\\ntreatment, or lifestyle changes. However, genetic testing has limitations. When a genetic test\\ndetects a mutation, the test cannot always determine when or what symptoms of the condition\\nmay show, which symptoms will occur first, how severe the condition will be, or how the\\ncondition will progress over time. Even if a test is negative, an individual may still be at risk\\nfor a condition.\\nDue to the complexity of the medical and emotional issues involved in genetic testing, it is\\nimportant to speak to a health professional such as a genetic counselor to help you understand\\nthe benefits and risks of genetic testing and to answer any questions you may have before and\\nafter testing.

Several types of prenatal testing\\nare available, depending on which trimester of pregnancy the mother is in and the type of\\ncondition in question. This appendix provides an overview of different prenatal tests that may\\nbe offered to pregnant women.\\nWho Is Offered Testing?\\nAll pregnant women, regardless of age, have the option to undergo prenatal testing.

So the age\\nof the mother is the most common reason for prenatal testing.\\nOther reasons that a woman may be offered prenatal testing include:\\n• Family history or a previous child with a genetic condition\\n• Parents who are known carriers of a specific genetic condition\\n• Abnormal ultrasound findings\\n• Screening test results\\nAny woman who desires more information about the developing fetus can consider prenatal\\ntesting.

First\\ntrimester screening involves an ultrasound examination and a sample of the mother’s blood,\\nwhile second trimester screening involves just the blood sample. Some women may also be\\noffered a combination of first and second trimester screening, known as either “integrated” or\\n“combined” screening. The blood results and ultrasound results are then combined with\\nmaternal factors such as age and weight to calculate the chance for certain chromosomal\\nconditions in the current pregnancy.\\nScreening results are usually available within a week, and those who receive a positive result are\\noffered diagnostic testing. The detection rate for screening tests varies by the type of test\\nperformed. The only way to know for certain whether or not a developing baby has a\\nchromosomal condition is by performing a diagnostic test.\\nDiagnostic Tests\\nCertain diagnostic tests are procedures that can determine with greater than 99.9 percent\\naccuracy whether or not a developing baby has a chromosomal difference. The two types of\\ndiagnostic tests are chorionic villus sampling (CVS) and amniocentesis. Diagnostic tests for\\nspecific genetic diseases must be specially requested. These tests have different accuracy rates,\\ndepending on which test is ordered.\\nCVS is performed between 10.5 to 13.5 weeks of pregnancy. During the procedure, a doctor\\nobtains a small tissue sample from the placenta by either inserting a thin needle through the\\nwoman’s abdomen or by using a small catheter inserted through the cervix. The method used\\ndepends on the location of the baby and the placenta.\\nAmniocentesis is performed from 15 weeks of pregnancy onward. During amniocentesis, a thin\\nneedle is inserted through the woman’s abdomen into the amniotic sac to withdraw a small\\nsample of fluid from around the developing baby.\\nThe cells collected from either procedure can be used for chromosomal analysis or other genetic\\ntests, as ordered. The results from the chromosomal analysis usually take two weeks; while the\\nresults from other genetic tests may take longer, depending on what test has been ordered.\\nDiagnostic test procedures are associated with a chance for miscarriage, which is estimated to be\\nup to 1 percent for CVS, and less than 1 percent for amniocentesis.Appendix H: Prenatal Screening and Testing (continued)\\n'),\n",

The type of test employed depends on the type of\\nabnormality being measured. In general, three categories of genetic testing—cytogenetic,\\nbiochemical, and molecular—are available to detect abnormalities in chromosome structure,\\nprotein function, and DNA sequence, respectively.\\nCytogenetic T esting. Cytogenetics involves the examination of chromosomes to identify structural\\nabnormalities. Chromosomes of a dividing human cell can be analyzed clearly in white blood\\ncells, specifically T lymphocytes, which are easily collected from blood. Cells from other tissues\\nsuch as bone marrow, amniotic fluid, and other tissues can also be cultured for cytogenetic\\nanalysis. Following several days of cell culture, chromosomes are fixed, spread on microscope\\nslides, and stained. The staining methods for routine analysis allow each of the chromosomes to\\nbe individually identified. The distinct bands of each chromosome revealed by staining allow for\\nanalysis of the chromosomal structure.\\nFluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) is a process that vividly paints chromosomes or\\nportions of chromosomes with fluorescent molecules to identify chromosomal abnormalities\\n(e.g., insertions, deletions, translocations, and amplifications). FISH is commonly used to\\nidentify specific chromosomal deletions associated with pediatric syndromes such as DiGeorge\\nsyndrome (a deletion of part of chromosome 22, also called del22) and cancers such as chronic\\nmyelogenous leukemia (a translocation involving chromosomes 9 and 22).\\nBiochemical T esting. Clinical testing for a biochemical disease utilizes techniques that examine\\nthe protein instead of the gene. Many biochemical genetic diseases are known as “inborn errors\\nof metabolism” because they are present at birth and disrupt a key metabolic pathway.\\nDepending on the disease, tests can be developed to directly measure protein activity (direct\\nmeasurement of enzyme activity), level of metabolites (indirect measurement of enzyme\\nactivity), and the size or quantity of protein (protein structure). These tests require a tissue\\nsample in which the protein is present, typically blood, urine, amniotic fluid, or cerebrospinal\\nfluid. Because gene products may be more unstable than DNA or RNA and can degrade\\nquickly, the sample must be collected, stored properly, and shipped promptly according to the\\nlaboratory’s specifications.\\nA variety of technologies such as high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas\\nchromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS), and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) enable\\nboth qualitative detection and quantitative determination of metabolites. In addition, bioassays\\nmay employ flourometric, radioisotopic, or thin-layer chromatography methods.\\nMolecular T esting. Direct DNA analysis is applicable when the gene sequence of interest is\\nknown. For small DNA mutations, direct DNA testing is typically the most effective method,\\nparticularly if the function of the protein is unknown and a biochemical test cannot be\\ndeveloped. A DNA test can be performed on any tissue sample and requires very small amountsA N e w Yo r k – M i d - A t l a n t i c G u i d e f o r Pat i e n t s a n d H e a lt h P r o f e s s i o n a l s78\\nAppendix I.

Several different molecular technologies, including direct sequencing, polymerase\\nchain reaction-based assays (PCR), and hybridization, can be used to perform testing. PCR is a\\ncommon procedure used to amplify targeted segments of DNA through repeated cycles of\\ndenaturation (heat-induced separation of double-stranded DNA), annealing (binding of specific\\nprimers of the target segment to parent DNA strand), and elongation (extension of the primer\\nsequences to form a new copy of the target sequence). The amplified product can then be\\nfurther tested. For some genetic diseases, many different mutations can occur in the same gene\\nand result in the disease, making molecular testing challenging. However, if the majority of cases\\nof a particular genetic disease are caused by a few mutations, this group of mutations is first\\ntested before more comprehensive testing such as sequencing is performed.\\nComparative genomic hybridization (CGH) or chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) is a\\nmolecular cytogenetic method for analyzing gains or losses in DNA that are not detectable with\\nroutine chromosome analysis. The method is based on the proportion of fluorescently-labeled\\npatient DNA to normal-reference DNA. CGH can detect small deletions and duplications, but\\nnot structural chromosomal changes such as balanced reciprocal translocations or inversions or\\nchanges in chromosomal copy number.\\nDNA microarray analysis, also referred to as gene, genome, or DNA chip analysis, is a tool for\\ndetermining gene expression. Molecules of mRNA bind, or hybridize, specifically to a DNA\\ntemplate, typically a gene or portion of a gene, from which it originated. When an array\\ncontains many DNA templates, the expression level of hundreds to thousands of genes from an\\nindividual patient sample can be measured using a computer to detect the amount of mRNA\\nbound to each site on the array.\\nProtein microarray analysis is used to quantify the amount of protein present in biological\\nsamples. Similar to chromosome and DNA microarray analysis, the hybridization of labeled\\ntarget proteins in a patient sample is measured against a reference sample. Also referred to as a\\nbiomarker, the presence, absence, increase, or decease of a particular protein can be an indicator\\nof disease in a person. For example, analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid of a patient for amyloid\\nbeta or tau proteins may be used to diagnose Alzheimer’s disease.\\nReferences\\nGreenwood Genetic Center.

PKU is an inherited metabolic disease that\\nis caused by a mutation of the gene for an enzyme responsible for metabolism of the amino acid\\nphenylalanine. Children who are identified early can avoid foods with phenylalanine, thereby avoiding\\nbuildup of the amino acid, which would otherwise lead to brain damage and mental retardation.\\nWhen Dr. Guthrie introduced a system for collection and transportation of blood samples on filter\\npaper, cost-effective, wide-scale genetic screening became possible.\\nWithin 48 hours of a child’s birth,\\na sample of blood is obtained\\nfrom a “heel stick.” The blood\\ncan be analyzed for more than 50\\nlife-threatening diseases, including\\nPKU, sickle cell disease, and\\nhypothyroidism. The sample,\\ncalled a “blood spot,” is tested at a\\nstate public health laboratory or\\nother participating lab. Each state\\nhas its own newborn screening\\npanel that tests for different\\nconditions. Decisions for adding\\nor deleting tests involve many complex social, ethical, and political issues. Usually, newborn screening\\ndisorders are selected based on disease prevalence, detectability, treatment availability, outcome, and\\noverall cost-effectiveness. The American College of Medical Genetics and the March of Dimes\\nrecommend that all babies be screened for a core panel of 29 disorders and a hearing screening. Slightly\\nless than half of all states offer screening for this panel of 29 disorders.\\nReferences\\nAdvisory Committee on Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children\\nwww.hrsa.gov/heritabledisorderscommittee\\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention\\nwww.cdc.gov/nceh/dls/newborn.htm\\nMarch of Dimes\\nwww.marchofdimes.com\\nNational Newborn Screening and Genetics Resource Center\\ngenes-r-us.uthscsa.eduA N e w Yo r k – M i d - A t l a n t i c G u i d e f o r Pat i e n t s a n d H e a lt h P r o f e s s i o n a l s80\\nAppendix J.

Birth Defects\\nA birth defect happens while a fetus is developing in the womb. Congenital abnormalities refer\\nto features or conditions that a baby is born with, as opposed to conditions that develop later in\\nlife. About one in 33 babies in the U.S is born with a birth defect.\\nA birth defect may cause physical or mental disabilities. It can affect almost any part of the body\\nand can range from mild to severe. Some birth defects can be corrected by surgery or other\\nmedical treatments. These children can lead healthy lives. But some birth defects are very severe\\nand can even cause death. Some birth defects such as a clubfoot or cleft lip are relatively\\nnoticeable, but others such as heart defects may require imaging tests like an ultrasound. Not all\\nbirth defects can be detected prenatally (before birth).\\nSome of the most common birth defects affect the heart. About one in every 200 to 300 babies\\nis born with a heart defect. Depending on the type and severity of the heart defect, it may be\\ncorrected by surgery. Another common group of birth defects is called “neural tube” defects.\\nThese are due to abnormal development of the baby’s spine or brain and affect about one in\\n1,000 babies. These defects are sometimes very severe, causing early death or severe paralysis.\\nBirth defects of the lip and the roof of the mouth are also common. They are referred to as cleft\\nlip and cleft palate and affect about one in 700 to 1,000 babies.\\nMany birth defects are caused by multiple factors, both genetic and environmental. For example,\\nthe risk of neural tube defects is increased in families with a history of neural tube defects, but\\nthe risk can be reduced with folic acid supplements (4 mg per day) during early pregnancy.\\nUncontrolled medical conditions of the mother—for example, diabetes or PKU—can lead to\\nbirth defects. Some medicines such as Accutane are known to cause birth defects.\\nTo learn more about your risk of having a baby with a birth defect, talk with your doctor\\nor a genetic counselor. In particular, women should consult their doctor before becoming\\npregnant to begin multi-vitamin supplements containing folic acid, get help managing their\\nmedical conditions, decide which medications are safe to take, and avoid exposure to alcohol,\\ndrugs, and tobacco.\\nResources\\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention\\nwww.cdc.gov/ncbddd/bd\\nMedline Plus\\nwww.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/birthdefects.html'),\n",

Teratogens are usually discovered after an increased prevalence of a\\nparticular birth defect. For example, in the early 1960s, a drug known as thalidomide was used\\nto treat morning sickness. Exposure of the fetus during the early stages of development results in\\ncases of phocomelia, a congenital malformation in which the hands and feet are attached to\\nabbreviated arms and legs. Teratogens can also be found at home or the workplace. The effect is\\nrelated to type of agent, dose and duration, and time of exposure. The first half of pregnancy is\\nthe time when fetuses are most vulnerable to teratogen exposures.\\nTeratogenic agents include infectious agents (rubella, cytomegalovirus, varicella, herpes simplex,\\ntoxoplasma, syphilis, etc.), physical agents (ionizing agents, hyperthermia), maternal health\\nfactors (diabetes, maternal PKU), environmental chemicals (organic mercury compounds,\\npolychlorinated biphenyl or PCB), herbicides and industrial solvents, and drugs (prescription,\\nover-the-counter, or recreational). In general, if medication is required, the lowest dose possible\\nshould be used, and combination drug therapies and first trimester exposures should be avoided\\nif possible.\\nThe types or severity of abnormalities caused by a teratogenic agent are also dependent on the\\ngenetic susceptibilities of the mother and fetus. For example, variation in maternal metabolism\\nof a particular drug will determine what metabolites the fetus is exposed to and the duration\\nof exposure. The genetic susceptibility of the fetus to a particular teratogenic agent will also have\\nan effect on the final outcome.\\nT wo of the leading preventable causes of birth defects, developmental disabilities, and adverse\\npregnancy outcomes are alcohol and smoking. Alcohol use during pregnancy has significant\\neffects on the fetus. Alcohol can\\npass from the mother’s blood\\nstream through the placenta to\\nthe fetus. Since alcohol is\\nbroken down more slowly in a\\nfetus than in an adult, alcohol\\nlevels tend to remain high and\\nstay in the baby’s body longer.\\nBirth defects associated with\\nprenatal exposure to alcohol\\ncan occur in the first three to\\neight weeks of pregnancy,\\nbefore a woman even knows\\nthat she is pregnant.

Genetics in the healthcare setting concerns heritable variation that is related to health\\nand disease.\\n3. Molecular biology is the study of the structures and functions of macromolecules such\\nas nucleic acids and proteins.\\n4. Genomics is the study of the constitution of entire genomes—that is, all of the genetic\\nmaterial in an organism.\\n5. Proteomics is the study of the structure and functions of the protein products of the\\ngenes in the genome.\\n6. Individual genetic variation that leads to biochemical and molecular individuality\\nresults in part from the variable sequences of the four bases that are central components\\nof the DNA molecule.\\n7. Mutations introduce additional variation, but not all mutations have biological\\nsignificance. Some can be deleterious in varying degrees; others, fewer in number, may\\nprovide selective advantages that are useful to evolution. No differential selection, and\\ntherefore no evolution, would occur without mutation and variation. This principle\\nhelps explain phenomena such as the emergence of bacterial strains that are resistant to\\nantibiotics, as well as the obvious human differences we recognize in everyday life.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/08. Understanding Genetics Autor Genetic Alliance.pdf', 'page': 93}, page_content='8. Human variation results from the interactions among variable gene products and\\nenvironmental factors that vary from person to person in kind, duration, and\\nintensity. Variation is expressed at the molecular level in differences in sequences of\\namino acids and, therefore, in the structure and function of proteins that maintain\\nphysiological systems. It also is expressed in disease, which is a result of some\\nincompatibility between homeostatic variation and the individual’s experience with\\nthe environment. Because that is the case, genetics and genomics are the most basic\\nsciences for healthcare and the education of health professionals.\\n9. There is no fixed type—no archetypical individual—in a species, including Homo\\nsapiens. A species comprises a population of unique individuals that may vary in each\\nof their traits, including metabolism, immune responses, morphology, and behavior,\\nand, therefore, in expression of disease.\\n10. No sharp genetic boundaries exist between populations of human beings around\\nthe globe, and more genetic variation occurs within populations than between them.\\nThese facts make the designation of biological races scientifically untenable and\\nmake the grouping of people by phenotypes such as skin color a poor predictor\\nof other traits.\\n11. The genotype for a given trait is/are the gene(s) associated with that trait. The\\nphenotype is the expression of the genotype. That expression is mediated by protein\\ngene products that work in the context of experiences with the environment, through\\ndevelopment, maturation, and aging.\\n12. Some human traits, including diseases, result primarily from the action of the product\\nof one gene. Other human traits, including most common diseases, result from the\\nproducts of more than one gene acting in concert with the influence of environmental\\nvariables, which vary in kind, duration, and intensity through time.\\n13. The development of disease reflects three time frames: a) the evolutionary history—\\nbiological and cultural—of our species, which has produced the genome common to\\nall of us; b) the individual developmental history of each person, which interacts with\\nthe products of his or her genes; and c) the more immediate factors that result in the\\nexpression of disease at a particular moment.\\n14. The phrase “the gene for,” as in “the gene for phenylketonuria,” can be misleading. It\\ncan imply erroneously that only genetic influences are responsible for a given trait or\\ndisease, discounting the influence of the environment. The phrase also can suggest\\nthat only one gene is associated with a given trait, when there may be genetic\\nheterogeneity of alleles and modifiers, as well as multiple loci. The blood-group\\nsubstances and hemoglobin variants demonstrate such heterogeneity.A N e w Yo r k – M i d - A t l a n t i c G u i d e f o r Pat i e n t s a n d H e a lt h P r o f e s s i o n a l s92\\nAppendix Q.

Genetically-based healthcare, which now embraces genomics, is uniquely positioned\\nto provide insights into prevention because it acknowledges the individuality of each\\npatient and the biological and environmental influences that produce that\\nindividuality. Genetically-based care focuses primarily on the person who has the\\ndisease, not on the disease itself. It asks, “Why does this person have this disease at\\nthis point in his or her life?” And it recognizes that individual variation in genes,\\ndevelopment, and experiences means that each person has his or her own version of\\neach disease.\\nB. Principles Related To Cell Biology\\n1. Classic cell theory holds that all life is made of cells and that all cells come from\\npre-existing cells.\\n2. Cells pass through a series of structural and functional stages, known as the cell cycle.\\nThe cell cycle, which includes processes leading to cell division, is under genetic\\ncontrol. Cancer results from one or more disruptions in that cell cycle. Because most of\\nthese disruptions occur in somatic cells (as opposed to germ cells), all cancer is genetic\\nbut not all of it is inherited.\\n3. Cell division produces new cells.\\n4. Mitosis, one aspect of cell division, helps ensure genetic continuity from one\\ngeneration of somatic cells to the next. Human somatic cells contain 46\\nchromosomes (the diploid number): 22 pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex\\nchromosomes (X and Y).\\n5. Human germ cells, sperm and ova, contain 23 chromosomes (the haploid number). A\\nspecial process of cell division—meiosis—occurs in the precursors to germ cells. Meiosis\\nhas two major biological effects: it reduces the number of chromosomes from 46 to 23,\\nand it increases genetic variation through independent assortment and the exchange of\\ngenetic material between maternal and paternal chromosomes (crossing over). Meiotic\\nvariations can result in abnormalities of chromosome number or structure.\\n6. In Homo sapiens and other animals, fungi, and plants, cells contain a nucleus that\\nincludes chromosomes, the carriers of most of the genetic material (DNA).\\n7. Human cells also contain mitochondria. Because mitochondria were free-living organisms\\nearly in the evolution of life, they carry their own DNA, which now specifies proteins\\nthat are useful to us. Mutations in mitochondrial DNA can cause health problems.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/08. Understanding Genetics Autor Genetic Alliance.pdf', 'page': 95}, page_content='C. Principles Related To Classical (Mendelian) Genetics\\n1. Our understanding of the behavior of chromosomes during meiosis allows us to make\\npredictions about genotype from one generation to the next.\\n2. Some traits are inherited through an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance, others\\nthrough an autosomal recessive pattern. Still others, those traits associated with genes\\non the X chromosome, follow somewhat different patterns of transmission because the\\nmale has only one X chromosome.\\n3. T raits, not genes, are dominant or recessive. It is convenient, even traditional, to refer\\nto genes as dominant or recessive. But, today it is anachronistic because of our new\\nknowledge of how protein gene products influence phenotype.\\n4. Aberrations in the behavior of chromosomes during meiosis can result in structural or\\nnumerical alterations that have serious consequences for growth and development.\\nSome of these aberrations occur more frequently in the offspring of older mothers.\\nOthers arise more frequently during the formation of sperm. We can detect many\\nchromosomal aberrations prenatally. They account for a significant proportion of fetal\\ndeaths and, to a lesser extent, death in infancy.\\n5. Our understanding of genes in populations allows us to make predictions about the\\npresence of genes in individuals and given populations and, therefore, about the\\nvariable frequencies of disease phenotypes.\\n6. During the last two decades, research has uncovered genetic mechanisms that extend\\nour understanding of non-Mendelian inheritance and provide biological explanations\\nfor heretofore-unexplained observations. These mechanisms such as imprinting,\\ntrinucleotide repeats, and epigenesis, however, do not alter our fundamental\\nunderstanding of the rules that govern genetic and molecular processes.\\nD. Principles Related To Molecular Genetics\\n1. DNA and RNA are information molecules; they store biological information in digital\\nform in a well-defined code.\\n2. DNA is the primary information molecule for virtually all life on earth; this is but one\\npiece of evidence for the relatedness of all life through evolution.\\n3. DNA does very little by itself. It is a stable storehouse of genetic information, but it\\ntakes proteins to put the information to use. DNA’s transcription and the translation of\\nits information into protein are accomplished by protein-mediated mechanisms.\\nSimilarly, the functions of the organs and body are carried out by sets of proteins\\nwhose properties and actions are not likely to be understood or predicted by our\\ncurrent knowledge of single genes or proteins.A N e w Yo r k – M i d - A t l a n t i c G u i d e f o r Pat i e n t s a n d H e a lt h P r o f e s s i o n a l s94\\nAppendix Q.

The structure of DNA lends itself to replication. DNA replicates with great accuracy,\\nwhich is critical to the proper transmission of genetic information from one generation\\nof cells to the next and from one generation of organisms to the next.\\n5. Sometimes errors arise during DNA replication, and evolution has produced\\nmechanisms that repair such mistakes. In fact, some of those mechanisms present in\\nHomo sapiens are conserved evolutionarily all the way back to the bacterium E. coli.\\nWhen repair mechanisms fail, mutations may remain. Some may become the basis for\\nevolutionary change.\\n6. In most biological systems, the flow of information is: DNA to RNA to protein. The\\nprocesses by which this occurs are replication of the DNA, transcription of the DNA\\ninto messenger RNA, and translation of the messenger RNA into protein.\\n7. DNA is susceptible to damage by environmental insults such as radiation and certain\\nchemicals. The damage that occurs to our DNA during the course of our lives can\\ncontribute to aging and the onset of cancer. Damage that occurs in the DNA of germ\\ncells—sperm and ova—is not completely repaired. Evolution is a possible result of\\nthese new, heritable variations.\\n8. A gene is a segment of DNA. Some genes code for the production of structural\\nproteins (collagen, for example) or enzymes (lactase, for example). Other genes are\\nregulatory, helping control processes such as prenatal development and ongoing\\ncellular functions.\\n9. A gene occupies a particular place on a chromosome: a locus. A gene can have two or\\nmore alternative forms—alleles—but only one allele at a time can occupy a given\\nlocus on a given chromosome.\\n10. Because proteins direct the operations of cells, statements like “gene-environment\\ninteraction” are inaccurate. The interaction is actually between the environment—for\\nexample, oxygen, food, drug, or antigen—and the protein products of the genes.\\nE. Principles Related To Development\\n1. The human life span comprises three major phases: development, including\\nembryological development and growth after birth until maturation; maturation; and\\naging. Progression through the stages is continuous; however, apart from birth, it is\\ndifficult to tell where one ends and the next begins.\\n2. Although virtually all human beings proceed through the same developmental stages,\\nindividual differences occur in the rate of progression.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/08. Understanding Genetics Autor Genetic Alliance.pdf', 'page': 97}, page_content='3. Embryological development begins with the fusion of sperm and ovum. This event\\nrestores the diploid number and initiates a complex series of events that involves an\\nincrease in the number of cells; differentiation of the zygote into the specialized cells,\\ntissues, and organs that make up a new, individual organism; and growth of the\\norganism itself.\\n4. Embryological development is under genetic control. That is, particular genes must be\\nturned on and off at the correct time to ensure proper development.\\n5. Development is not, however, the simple unfolding of a genetic program resulting in\\na predictable end product. It involves the influence of maternal mitochondrial genes\\nand gene products at the time of fertilization, as well as significant and variable\\nnongenetic factors such as communication between cells, the migration of cells within\\nthe developing embryo, the proper spatial orientation of the embryo, and the effects\\nof environmental influences. These factors render the precise outcome of development\\nunpredictable and contribute to the uniqueness of each individual, the hallmark of\\nlife on earth.\\n6. Biologists have discovered a set of genes, called homeotic genes, that are central to\\nembryological development of the body plan. These genes are highly conserved\\nthroughout evolution. The genes even appear in the same order on the chromosomes\\nof species as distantly related as round worms, fruit flies, mice, and human beings.\\nBiologists, therefore, are able to study the genetic and molecular aspects of human\\ndevelopment by studying those processes in other species.\\n7. The Human Genome Project has provided the complete DNA sequences of all\\nhuman genes and will allow more detailed analysis of the genetic regulation of\\ndevelopment. Likewise, the ability to analyze the protein products of genes involved\\nin development will improve our understanding of the many and varied complex\\nsteps that produce a new individual.\\n8. The evolutionary changes that lead to the production of new species undoubtedly\\nresult from rare, beneficial changes during embryological development of individual\\norganisms. Most embryological changes will be small, however, because the system\\nwill not tolerate major deviations from the basic developmental plan.\\n9. Environmental agents such as radiation or drugs can interfere with embryological\\ndevelopment, resulting in birth defects and, more likely, fetal death. Various\\ntechnologies allow detection of some of these abnormalities in utero.\\n10. Unlike development in species whose newborns are juveniles, development in Homo\\nsapiens continues throughout infancy, and the juvenile period is long. This requires\\nprolonged parental investment and exposes the still-developing organism to the\\npossibility of environmental insults.A N e w Yo r k – M i d - A t l a n t i c G u i d e f o r Pat i e n t s a n d H e a lt h P r o f e s s i o n a l s96\\nAppendix Q.

Principles Related To New Genetic Technology\\n1. Advances in technology allow us to analyze and manipulate the genetic material in ways\\nthat were not possible even a few years ago.\\n2. These technologies allow us to identify, isolate, and test for genes associated with\\ndisease and, in the future, perhaps for traits that have no clinical significance.\\n3.
